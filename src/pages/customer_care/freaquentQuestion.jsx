                            The general belief is that a driver's oil should be changed every 3,000 to 7,000 miles, or every three months. You can, however, always consult your owner's manual for the suggested oil change interval for your individual make and model. Many of today's newer vehicles will even notify you when they need service. Remember that an oil change is necessary since it lubricates the internal cogs and gears under the hood. Without it, oil might clog and prevent your vehicle from running properly.

                            Aside from engine oil, numerous other fluids are essential to the health of your car. Transmission fluid, brake fluid, engine coolant, and power-steering fluid are a few examples. Their levels are influenced not only by how frequently you drive, but also by high temperatures. As a result, experts recommend monitoring them at the same time as your oil change or every month or two.

                            On average, brake pads begin to wear out at 20,000 to 30,000 miles, however this figure is subject to a variety of circumstances. Knowing what symptoms to look for can thus help you determine when your brake pads need to be replaced. If your car is taking longer to stop or you hear a high-pitched screaming or grinding noise when braking, a checkup is essential. Running with worn brake pads will eventually compromise the rotors, which can be an expensive repair, so being proactive will not only keep you safe but will also save you money.
